So i thought I made something like this before but I'm not seeing it.

I think, however, I can use 
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation-iterators-for-grouped-data
Groups, and threshold to create a group.

The most test like group

So it sounds like the first thing to do is to train an estimator that can predictt
the liklihood of something being in the test set or not

Then given a data set, threshold data
return https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#predefined-fold-splits-validation-sets
predefined split with 0 for the validation set dervied from the dataset
see: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.PredefinedSplit.html#sklearn.model_selection.PredefinedSplit

Then we have a cross validator that can be used, reused based on threshold.

should sketch out responsibilties and then decompose with SOLID
